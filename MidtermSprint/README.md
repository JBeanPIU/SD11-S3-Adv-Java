Hi!

This is my submission for the midterm sprint of semester 3 at Keyin College!

This is a Java based program based on a library. The target of this assessment is to create a library menu, using multiple classes to gather patron, author, and other book related information 
to then expand it towards an interactive menu! This menu allows you to do many things, like adding a book or periodical, editing any of the 6 provided tests, deleting, etc.

It was a lot, but the five following classes/programs MUST be added together or else LibraryDemo.java (the main class to test all functions) will not work properly or at all.

To run, when in VSCode or IntelliJ:

-Make sure you're on LibraryDemo.java
-A menu will appear with seven different options
-Choosing 1-7 will give you different prompts
-When finished, you can type in 7 to Exit, or simply shut down the program

I guess it didn't really need much of an explanation, since it's a very simple setup.

Thanks for looking!

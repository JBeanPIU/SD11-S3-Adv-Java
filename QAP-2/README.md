Everything was done over the course of a few days (starting on the 4th, but I updated the information throughout to represent the day I specifically finished the code)

It was sent all at once mostly because I completely forgot to add it onto gitHub and without using commit changes (still not used to it LOL)

However, this is QAP 2 of Advanced Java. Generally straightforward, it was an assignment with three problems;

-TestMyLine.java
-TestMyRectangle.java
-CreditCardDemo.java

The first two were about using the system output to generate given points to accurately describe a line and rectangle respectively.
CreditCard demo was a bit more advanced, requiring multiple files to store sensitive information regarding customers (name, address, cred card info, etc), 
and as such to prevent the file from getting too convoluted I nested all of the files for problem 3 inside the folder shown.

I'll make sure to commit changes next time and NOT to just upload it as a file, completely crossed my mind while doing this one!!

Hope everything works properly, if not I'm cooked
